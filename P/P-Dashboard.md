now we need to make the dashboard,


technicals:
- there will be 2 main pages: dashboard and the brand page.
- dashboard will intuitively list all of the brands and allow you to add new brands. we should also be able to search for brands.
    - for each brand, we should be able to see their status and last updated.
- brand page will show the data for the brand, look at the backend endpionts to see what exists. keep the brand page empty for now.
- use shadcn/ui for the components, make it dark mode & matche the current style and theme of modern yet simple websites.

you will need to install tailwindcss and shadcn/ui for the components.
- their documentation has changed and your knowledge is outdated, you will need to websearch for the latest information.
